Notable features:
- Font loading and rendering using signed distance fields.
- Cache system for storing expensive calculations between application executions.
- Basic 2D rendering done with shaders and batching/instancing.
- Quake like console with input and variables.
- Elegant logging system using stream operators.
- Scripting engine using Lua where the entire game resides.
- Entity/Component scene system.

====
1. Download and extract [Boost 1.61](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost). (Forgive me...)
2. Execute ```bootstrap``` and ```b2 --with-filesystem``` inside Boost directory.
3. Define ```BOOST_ROOT``` environmental variable that points to Boost directory.
4. Run one of the batch files located in Project directory. (e.g. ```Project\CMake-VS2015.bat```)
